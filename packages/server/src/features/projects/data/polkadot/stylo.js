  "Stylo is an offline wallet that brings user friendliness to the front seat. It allows storing funds offline. Any interaction with the online world happens by scanning QR codes. Transactions are scanned, using the phoneâ€™s camera. They can then be reviewed and signed offline, and finally transmitted to an online wallet by scanning a QR code displayed on the phone, by a computer webcam. Stylo means pen in french.";
